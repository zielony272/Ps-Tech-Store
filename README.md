# Ps-Tech-Store
This app is designed for downloading games/game ports/apps etc. Dedicated for channel Playstationtech. App will be developed more in the future.
For now it has a few options:
 - download option for big game ports
 - files delete  option for downloaded files. Ux0:/download/ + filename by default
 - files unzip option for unpacking game files to specific directory on vita. Ux0:/data by default
 - redirection to special website for downloading vpks
 - autochecker if user have any website download plugin installed


Instalation:
I have some problems with building vpk so you'll need to manually unzip the app file and move "PSTECHSTO" folder directly to your ux0:/app. There's possibility that will be changed in the future but it's the only way of installation for now
